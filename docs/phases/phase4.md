### Phase 4: Comments, Search, Navigation Menu (1 day)

Looking back:
And I’m done with my MVP (minimum viable product)!  I’m way ahead of schedule.  The site looks pretty decent too, as I styled each component as I was building it.  There are basically 5 main pages (not including the landing page and login/sign up pages): the drawing app, the index/browse page, the search page, the current user’s profile page, and the page that shows full-size drawings (with other details like likes, comments, title, artist).  There’s a bit of fine tuning to be done to my search page, but other than that, I can start implementing bonus features!  Right now, my drawing app is very very basic—there is only one size for brushes and erasers (1pixel), and only a limited number of colors to choose from.  I want to first add a color selection tool, so that users can make new colors and save them to the palette.  Then, I want to work on the paintbucket, which will allow users to fill in large portions of the drawing with a given color.  I have a lot of other ideas for bonuses too, and I get another week to implement them, which is awesome.
